<h2>JPro Extensions Translations</h2>

Welcome to JPro Extensions translations repository. This repository allows our users to contribute with the community by translating our Joomla!™ extensions translation files to other languages.

We have received several contributions but, being unable to verify the translations in some languages, we thought that a community based translation would ensure a more reliable result.

<h3>How to contribute with your translations?</h3>
<p>If you're new to GitHub, follow the guidelines <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo" target="_blank">here</a> about "Forking a Repository and then you can start working on your own copy of the files and do "Pull requests" so that your translations ma be included in our main repo.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
Before you start a translation, check if there is already a directory for the language you'll be translating (ex: de-DE/) and if so, go ahead and edit the files inside, otherwise, in your own copy, create the directory(ies) following the same hierarchy as the main en-GB and create the files inside.

When you're done, you can do a pull request and we will check the structure and merge the translations into our master repo.

<strong>Notes:</strong>
  - make sure you add to the top of each file your own data - author and optionally your website.
  - in case of doubt, read te Joomla!™ translation guidelines <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/Technical_Guidelines_for_Translation" target="_blank">here</a>


Thank you for your contribution.
